# La Patente

### The goal of this project is to simulate the Italian driving license exam with Python.  

The meaterials (questions, answers and images) are automatically stored in a SQL database.
I am not sure the questions and answers are completely true or updated. I just choosed a website for
extracting the required raw data.

## Usage

- First you need to create a database ```patentedb``` in MySQL.
- Then you should run ```patenteSQL.py```.
- Wait until all the data are extracted and stored (it also depends on your Internet connection).
- Run ```test.py```

## Important
Do not delete ```pat.png```

If everything works well, you will see the GUI and you can start the test!
